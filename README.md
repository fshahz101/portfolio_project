Portfolio Project - Learning & Practicing HTML, CSS & Javascript
 - This project is part of my learning experience. As of this point, I have learned HTML and will be starting CSS and Javascript soon.
 - My plan is to update the project and add styling and functionality as I upgrade my skills with new languages.
 - Your feedback is appreciated  - SAM
